I am writing this to let you know how much you mean to me,
you mean a damn lot to me and I would do anything to keep you by my side
life is complex, it's difficult and that scares the hell out of me,
especially going through it all alone which is why I wish I could
squeeze the damn hell out of you right now and cuddle you into my arms.

You've given me a lot throughout our time together, I know it's not been all good as there have been the fair share of battles - we're left with the scars on our hearts to prove that,
every single day we go through a new battle, which is why we should fight for our love, the way you make me feel is magical,
you make me feel like a <em>cup of tea</em> it's warm, and feels like a tight hug - I could do with a lot of those from you, this Christmas won't be a miracle without you,
the best gift the universe has ever given me.
<br><br>
Thank you for being in my life, for bringing me joy, and comfort. I'm sorry that I am not the best boyfriend, I am sorry that I become a mess over the littlest things,
You say that I don't love you, or that I don't care about you which is far from the truth - my brain is intoxicated with thoughts of you being with another guy, and I hate it, I hate the thought of you being with another guy,
I get to the point that throughout the day every little detail becomes a sign to me, and the ones that make my brain feel as if it's concrete evidence that you are hiding something/someone from me, I just explode,
I can't handle the thought of you being with another guy as I want you to belong to me, I want you all to myself, that's really selfish of me and I'm sorry.
<br><br>
My selfish feelings, my selfish behaviour is causing you a hideous amount of pain, suffering and prolonged trauma leaving scars on your precious body - I don't want for in the future for you to be looking back
on your arms and saying... all these scars are from the cuts that I did over him, over that one person that made me feel like shit and expected me to still go running back to him and regardless of what I want,
I know that you will be looking back on those scars that I caused, and I am so terribly sorry that I did cause this.
<br><br>
I could have prevented this, I could have and should have seeked help for my own behaviour to stop it affecting you, and yet here we are, I've caused you an onslaught of pain due to my selfish, disgusting actions.
I do not ever expect your forgiveness, you should not forgive me, and I should not seek it either - the only time I would even be partly eligible for forgiveness is when I do seek help, when I do change my behaviour.
<br><br>
What would you like to do? What would you like to see change?
<br><br>
There have been a lot of "I" comments from me, it's time for me to ask you what you want, what you need, what it is that you want to see change. Do you want to work this out, with me? Together?
You are my loved one after all, you are my family.
<br><br>
Please can we spend Christmas together, IRL. This is one of those special days where I am going to stand my ground on and beg you to be with me, there's too much trauma for me around Christmas, just wanted this one to a Christmas to remember..
I'm truly sorry if that is too much to ask, we should not be arguing in Christmas, and it's my fault cause I caused it - I've caused all of it, I 100% heard the android notification sound and I just completely flipped when you denied it and call me paranoid,
I didn't handle it well, the pain of the thought of you cheating on me is too much.
<br><br>
You always know how to put a smile on my face when I do feel down, when I feel like it's the end of the world, it's take a strong, courageous spirit such as yours to change the world, to make others happy - I should know because you changed my world,
Being with you it has changed my world, and anyone that gets to know you is lucky af.
<br><br>
You've given me what I need: purpose, a reason to live, motivation, structure, a life line. I don't know any girl, any person that is willing to be as real with people as you are, you know how to brighten up my day, you fill me with warmth and I don't ever want to lose that,
I wish to be a better person to you, I have to be for you, for our future children, how can I be a father if all I am is an asshole.
<br><br>
Thank you for being in my life, thank you for being right here by my side - you didn't fail me, not at all, and you shouldn't say such harsh and horrible things about yourself. I don't ever want you to get run over by a car ffs, I want to hold you and cuddle you into my arms
and I can't thank you enough for caring so much, my arm was in pain yet it will be okay; Ain't some cuts on my arm gonna hold me back, we're gonna get through this together and that I am sure of.
<br><br>
I hope that you start writing self-affirmation messages, you are wonderful and you have got to show yourself that - please stop tearing yourself down for me, I love you and I won't stop loving you, you needed your sleep, you need your sleep to recover from the pain that you are feeling,
to recover your strength. Don't beat yourself up, we're gonna have a great day together and many more to come.
<br><br>
Please for the love of god, look inwards to see how amazing you are. <b>I want to remind you to not change for anyone, not even me.</b>
<br><br>
If you think for 1 second that I want to live in this universe without you then you are so damn wrong, I know I am not perfect, I know that I fuck up, if anything it should be you that doesn't want to be with me - you mean everything to me, and I wouldn't be surprised if one day I woke up,
and you told me that you didn't want to be with me anymore. After all the pain I have caused you, after all our days together that I have ruined, after how shit I have treated you these past couple of days, why would someone like me deserve you? You're my happy place, my safe place, my comfort.
It's selfish for me to be able to be able to be with you, who is someone that is of high value, you're amazing and you deserve the best.
<br><br>
With confidence, I can say that I am not the best, nowhere near it actually. My insecurities, my behaviour, my weaknesses, and me being an asshole in general is what is holding me back from being a better boyfriend, actually no.. my decisions, my choices on how I decide to deal with all of that
is my problem, to seek out a therapist/shrink/councellor/etc, to be willing and open to change is what will improve me as a person. The way I have been lately, it's not been good and I'm falling, I want you to hold me yet how can I be so selfish to ask the person I love to keep picking me up
when it's time for me help pick you up?
<br><br>
I'm sorry for not always being there for you, I'm sorry for always hurting you, I'm sorry for ever encouraging you to bad things to yourself, I am sorry that you changed because of me. I sit here, and I can not think of one good reason about me as to why you stay with me - why do you want me?
Why don't you want someone who is more down to earth? More laid back? Someone who is playful and witty? Someone who doesn't make mistakes, thinking the wrong person is you in OW?, You deserve someone better than that, you are deserving of someone who can make you feel good.
<br><br>
Where is my worth?

<p style="margin-left:5px;">
As you can see, the list goes on, and on, and on. I am horrible to you, I am disgusted in myself and I need to start being a much better boyfriend to you. I really love you, I'm sorry for being such a moron, I'm sorry for not being a decent human being, I'm sorry so sorry for making you feel
more sad than happy - you're only temporarily happy, when you are it's really good yet when you're not, all it is, is pain. That's why you hurt yourself, that's why you cry your eyes to sleep, that's why you have nightmares, because all you know is pain and your shit boyfriend just makes it worse
by causing you so much more pain.
<br><br>
You're probably thinking to yourself that you just want someone to love you, love you and not hurt you, I love you and I hurt you, I don't mean to hurt you, and yet it continues to happen. I hope to someday be the man of your dreams, as for now, I am not - I am just a lesser evil, or a worse evil,
depending on how you decide to look at it. I'm not good for you, I don't want to leave and sometimes it does feel well and truly that you will be better off without me, I destroy lives, you create them, I am nothing but pain and agony - you say that you don't care if I love you bad,
I care.
<br><br>
You didn't deserve that I ruined our night over a stupid notification, if it wasn't from your phone then it must have been your housemate, me being a delusional bastard, or our DM calls being tapped.. I know for a fact that it was an android notification sound, whether an actual notification,
the battery notification sound, or something else like the charger being plugged in, I know for a fact it was an android sound and that it came from my headset; regardless, our night shouldn't have been ruined over that, I felt betrayed and angry because it felt like you had lied to me when I heard
the sound, and then called me paranoid.
<br><br>
It's really not nice to be told I'm paranoid in regards to my perception of reality, I forgive you for that though and I've let it go now. I love you, I love you so much, you are the better half of us, I'm sorry, this essay is really passive-aggressive - I am just typing how my mind is thinking,
one thing leads to the next, and then there's a ton of noise in my head then I somehow go back to talking about something completely unrelated.. my writing is all over the place, I can't say the same about yours though - your writing is immaculate, it's calming for my mind, and just genuinely
allows me to immerse myself visualising the events in a 3D playground inside my head.
<br><br>
Your writing is organised, you have a natural talent for policing your structure, your tempo and emotion of your writing which allows me to just sail like a boat on a calm sea - that or an even better description, you ride a rough sea with the boat as if it was a sail boat on a calm sea.
You are well and truly a master of your craft, you are my dove, my angel from the heavens, I don't deserve you and yet I have you for which I am beyond grateful for.
<br><br>
Don't listen to all the negativity you hear in your life, don't listen to the voices in your head, don't tear yourself down if you make a mistake, don't tear yourself down if you don't achieve your goals on the first attempt. Always look back, reflect, tell yourself can the hate be turned into justified criticism?
Or is it really just hateful, and something to ignore? 9 times out of 10, it is something hateful to ignore - the comment about your tattoos? Ignore it, you are beautiful just the way you are, if you want tattoos on your body then you can have them - it has nothing to do with anyone at work, on the streets,
or in concerts.
<br><br>
These people that tear you down are trying to bring you down to their level so they can feel good about themselves, they can't beat you with intelligence so they have to drag you down to their level and beat you with experience - smart, and intelligable people like you my lovely aren't experienced in tearing people down
as you're not a dickhead toxic asshole like them. You're wonderful, smart, cute, special, delicate, fun to be around, you're my happy place, you're my beautiful baby girl, you're my soldier that goes through the jungle slashing past the vines, the tall grass and the swampy bog without complaining.
<br><br>
Remember that it's okay to not be okay, you're allowed to cry, you're allowed to scream into a pillow, you're allowed to rip a sock in half as long as it helps you to feel better about yourself. Hurting your body will only have you looking back on those scars and remembering the pain that caused them,
I wish the best for you and I really hope that by the end of 2023 you won't have any problems with ED, you definitely won't have it as bad as you do now because I'm going to make sure of it.
<br><br>
No hurting yourself, this means:
<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
  <li>No Laxatives</li>
  <li>No Damaging Your Skin, It's Not Paper Don't Cut It</li>
  <li>Your face isn't a mask, don't cover it.</li>
  <li>Your size isn't a book, don't judge it.</li>
  <li>Your life isn't a film, don't end it.</li>
  <li>Your heart isn't not a door so don't lock it.</li>
  <li>No Purging</li>
  <li>No Looking At ED Posts</li>
  <li>No Looking Up Ways To Hurt Yourself</li>
  <li>No Writing Down Hateful Things About Yourself</li>
  <li>Delete Any Apps That Encourage Your ED</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:5px;">
  I do hope that you are sleeping well and having the sweetest of dreams my beautiful angel, it's been a while since I've wrote a damn long essay for you so I figured I'd give it a shot - I hope that this provides you with some form of comfort, something to look over when I'm not here and you need to hear my voice,
  or you need me to hold you. <<em>In heart, mind, and soul I am right here by your side and I am not going anywhere</em>.
  <br><br>
  It's miraculous to me how you're so damn adorable, how you never fail to amaze me, why do you tear yourself down so much? Why are you trying to prove your worth to me when you should be proving to yourself how amazing you are? Work inwards and the external will follow, work external and you'll collapse under the pressure,
  To have a tower, you need the building blocks, you have got to see how amazing you are my lovely. You're everything to me, so please for the love of god find something, even if it's just 1 thing good about yourself and be god damn proud of yourself.. Your diet that you have been sticking to, have you seen improvements over
  a consistent basis?
  <br><br>
  Keep track of your progress, always do that - even get out the appropriate measuring instruments, as not always is progress measurable to the naked eye because when we think so negatively of ourselves we can make our eyes perceive an image that just isn't true, if we call ourselves ugly enough then no matter what we do,
  we will always see ourselves as ugly. Please start the process of loving yourself, you are loved, you are valued, and I fucking love you a shit ton bubba.
